# update-git

Run a bash script to update Git on your Mac to the latest version by replacing the PATH to Apple's git to the newly installed git distro. *Note this will also install homebrew if you don't have it installed already because we will use Homebrew to install/update Git.*

###### Steps:

           1. Download the script.sh
           2. Navigate to the Folder in which you placed the script
           3. One in the folder type:  chmod 755 script.sh
           4. While still in the folder where the script lives run the script with typing: ./script.sh
           5. Report Errors to my GitHub if encountered
